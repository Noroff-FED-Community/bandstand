Hello everyone, we have made the template for the project in figma.
so just follow this link https://www.figma.com/file/P3ynv0HPiRUggrIi1WnM2q/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=1zs3hWpLSLE8Ru1z-1

this is purely an example of how the page can look, the exception is the header and footer that will be the same one every page.
The main section will be open to interpet the design in your own way, only exception is that the specific artist page and their album page(s) should keep the same design pattern.

when we are assigning the work its all up to you how much you want to do. so just give us a heads up and we will assign you to as much work as you are willing to do.
