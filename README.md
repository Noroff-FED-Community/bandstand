Hello everyone, we have made the template for the project in figma.
so just follow this link https://www.figma.com/file/P3ynv0HPiRUggrIi1WnM2q/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=1zs3hWpLSLE8Ru1z-1

this is purely an example of how the page can look, the exception is the header and footer that will be the same one every page.
The main section will be open to interpet the design in your own way, only exception is that the specific artist page and their album page(s) should keep the same design pattern.

when we are assigning the work its all up to you how much you want to do. so just give us a heads up and we will assign you to as much work as you are willing to do.
If someone wants to do css let Marte or Jonas know, we need a css template for those who do not want to style their own HTML sheets.

Note: Use one h1 on each site, and give it a #id if you want a specific style to it, this can be styled later in the style.css file. 
We'll use one(1) CSS file so this needs some structure.

Jonas is available from 10.00am. He'll start a teams meeting for everyone on the project so he can give an intro and get your feedback and thoughts.
