# bandstand

Hello everyone, we have made the template for the project in figma.
so just follow this link https://www.figma.com/file/P3ynv0HPiRUggrIi1WnM2q/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=1zs3hWpLSLE8Ru1z-1

this is purely an example of how the page can look, the exception is the header and footer that will be the same one every page.
The main section will be open to interpet the design in your own way, only exception is that the specific artist page and their album page(s) should keep the same design pattern.

when we are assigning the work its all up to you how much you want to do. so just give us a heads up and we will assign you to as much work as you are willing to do.
If someone wants to do css let Marte or Jonas know, we need a css template for those who do not want to style their own HTML sheets.

Note: Use one h1 on each site, and give it a #id if you want a specific style to it, this can be styled later in the style.css file. 
We'll use one(1) CSS file so this needs some structure.

band and albums group!
ive added a bands folder to the repo. i made 2 of the bands that some of the group wanted to make, and for the rest of you, you have to make a new folder inside the bands folder, and give it the name of your band, inside your folder(insertbandname) you will make your bandname.html file pluss an folder for your album, inside the folder for the album, add "albumName".html

if you dont understand this explanation take a look at the two folders i placed inside the repo to get an idea, and if you still dont understand just give me a dm or call and i will help you. (Jonas Larsen)

the repo is ready to be pulled now and start your own branch, if you have any troubles with this, please give me a dm or call and i will help resolve the issues.
